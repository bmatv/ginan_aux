# ginan_aux
A backup set of auxiliary files for ginan

To get the files into the `ginan/examples` dir, please clone the repo into a separate dir which is not in `ginan` and then copy over the content of `ginan_aux` to the `ginan/examples`, as `cp -R ginan_aux/* ginan/examples/`. This will prevent writing any `.git*` files/dirs to the `ginan` dir which may interfere.
